          <h2>Wait a second, what's the 2030 agenda?</h2>
          <img src="/imgs/sdg.gif" id="img-1">
          <p>
          The 2030 agenda is a collection of goals, each focusing on a specific problem that afflicts the world.
          That’s not all though! Every goal has specific targets, which are smaller subgoals that would be good to have, even if the main goal isn’t achieved.
          There are a total of 17 goals and 169 targets (nice).
          </p>
        
          <!-- AUTHOR: GIOSUE/FRANCESCO  WHO WHY WHEN WHERE (2030)-->
          <h2 class="author-giosue">Who, why, when, and where</h2>
          <img src="/imgs/un-meeting.webp" id="img-1">
          <p class="author-giosue">
          The agenda was written on September 2015 by the United Nations, to guarantee a better future for our planet and it’s inhabitants.
          Even though it was written in 2015 it only became official in 2016.
          </p>

          <!-- AUTHOR: DONATO            WHAT (4) -->
          <h2>Sounds good, but what's this goal 4 about?</h2>
          <p>
          SDG 4 is meant to “ensure  inclusive  and  equitable  quality  education  and  promote  lifelong  learning  opportunities for all”.
          What this means is that it’s about bringing everyone on the same plane when it comes to education, no matter economic or social status, along with bettering existing infrastructure.
          </p>

          <!-- AUTHOR: CIRO              WHEN WHERE (4)-->
          <h2>Where are the problems?</h2>
          <p>
          Instruction and poverty are closely tied together: if you haven’t received the correct instruction you are not going to be able find a good job or to invoke your fundamental rights.
          Along with poverty comes analphabetism, which affects hundreds of millions of people.
          This is lots of times caused from dropping out of school at a very young age.
          All of this problems are most pronounced in South/West Asia, Africa and South America.
          </p>

          <!-- AUTHOR: GIOVANNI          HOW (4)-->
          <h2>I see, but how do we go about solving this?</h2>
          <img src="/imgs/4-5.gif" id="img-2">
          <p>
          Providing equal access to education goes hand in hand with addressing gender equality and poverty, as can be seen in goal 4’s targets.
          Goal 4’s aim is to eliminate the distinction between genders and social classes when it comes to learning and having the ability to learn.
          So more schools that are more affordable, more specialized, less biased and less unreachable (figuratively and literally).
          </p>

          <!-- AUTHOR: GIOVANNI          IDEAS (4)-->
          <h2>Couldn't we just...</h2>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>create and upgrade structures, and make them a safe space for all people?</li>
              <li>hire more teachers and school personnel?</li>
              <li>incentivize rich countries into contributing funds?</li>
            </ul>
          <p>
          <br>
          or maybe:
          </p>
            <ul>
            <br>
              <li>teach sustainable living and promote eco-friendly lifestyles?</li>
              <li>optimize structures for people with disabilities or special needs?</li>
            </ul>
          
          <p>
          <br>
          The short answer is, of course, it depends.
          But it mostly depends from you!
          </p>
          </p>

          <!-- AUTHOR: GIOVANNI          CONCLUSION (4)-->
          <h2>In conclusion</h2>
          <p>
          Different people have wildly different ideas on how effective, if at all, all this effort will be.
          Some say it'll just be all for nothing, while other choose to believe it'll guide us towards a better future, but in the end it's all up to you, your family, and your community to try and actually make the world a better place:
          try to educate yourself on what work is being done, why, where, by who, how and, even if indirectly, try and change things up for the better.
          That could be deciding to spread awareness, volunteer, or even simply vote for someone with more future concerned political views.
          Do what you can and, even if just by a little, the world will be better.
